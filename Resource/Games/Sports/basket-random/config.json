    "description": "Basket Random shares similar features with other games in the \"Random\" series: your characters defy the laws of physics and may react unexpectedly to your input. You can challenge the CPU or play with a friend.\nThis two-player basketball game shares the same concept as a typical basketball game: shoot the ball into the net, but with a few unusual and humorous twists. You can challenge the CPU or play with a friend.\nThere are two teams, each consisting of two players. Controls guide both your players, but be warned that their actions may not coincide with exactly how you expected them to move. Slam dunks are still very possible!\nUse the W key to control player one and the up arrow to control player two. Fight frantically over the basketball, bouncing and spinning in the air, trying to make the shot. Whatever team scores first wins that round. The first team to reach 5 wins the game!\nAfter each basket, youâ€™re transported to a new place where the court and the surroundings have changed, and physics and attire may differ, shaking up each new round with random changes! In some cases, players will have longer arms, in others, the ball might be heavier, or baskets might be worth double points! Bobble around, shooting hoops and having fun in this wacky take on basketball.",
