    "description": "The game's objective is to get the puck into the opponent's goal, but to get there, you'll need to position the puck so you can pass, shoot, and block one turn at a time. The field has 5 tokens on your team and 5 on your opponent's team. These are what you will use to shoot your puck. There is a time limit on each turn, and if you don't act fast, you will lose your turn if the time expires.\nTo move the puck, you need to hold and drag using the left button on the mouse to find the right force balance and perfect your aim. If your aim is off, pull back to cancel. You may not have enough time to figure out the perfect angle, so if you hesitate, you may lose your turn.\nThe game is fairly simple in movement and is a classic left-mouse hold-and-release game. The key is timing and direction.\nHold, aim, and shoot, but more importantly, have fun!",
