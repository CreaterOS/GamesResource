    "description": "Punchers throws players into the boxing ring for an intense boxing match where technique is key. Use the WASD keys to maneuver your fighter and get ready to throw jabs, cross punches, and more. The game features both realistic real-time matches as well as slow-motion combat, allowing players to perfect their moves and time their punches with precision.\nYou’ll be scored on total punches, landed punches, power punches, and accuracy. While you can spam the keys, success depends on skill and precision rather than random attacks. Take advantage of slow-motion mode to practice your moves and learn the timing needed for effective jabs and cross punches.\nEach punch has a recovery move, meaning you need to manage your timing carefully. Too many reckless attacks can leave you open for counter-punches. A stamina meter tracks your energy, helping you decide when to go on the offense or focus on defense to recover.\nAfter each round, you’ll get feedback on your performance, including stats like your best punch and overall effectiveness. If you win, expect a fun celebration with cheers, but if you lose, brace yourself for a bit of frustration.",
