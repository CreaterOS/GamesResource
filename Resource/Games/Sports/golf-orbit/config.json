    "description": "The key to Golf Orbit is to aim and hit the golf ball as far as possible. This one-button game has relatively easy gameplay, but getting that perfect shot can be challenging. Tap and hold your left mouse button to set the power and release to hit the ball. As the ball soars, it bounces off various objects, gaining extra distance but, if you hit a perfect shot, the ball can destroy the obstacles it faces, including trees and buildings.\nAs in regular golf, if your ball ends in water or in sand bunkers\nYour distance will be recorded with each shot, keeping you accountable for your progress. The goal is to achieve the longest distance possible with each swing.\nCollect Rewards\nCollect coins during the flight to upgrade your equipment and improve your shots. The goal is to achieve the longest distance possible with each swing. Points can be accumulated in various ways. The longer the distance you shoot, the more points you get. You can also unlock points with a surprise spin.\nIf you score a birdie (hole in 2 shots) or an eagle (hole in one), you'll amass way more points and will be able to improve the features of your future shots.\nThere are three elements to a perfect shot: strength, speed, and bounce. You can give each one of these a boost with reward points.",
