    "description": "Test your aiming skills\nFree Kick Classic is a simple game to play, yet it challenges your primary aim and instincts. Click on the ball, drag it toward the net, and release where you want to shoot. You can even affect the direction of the ball in mid-air. It can take a little while to get used to this mechanic, but it’s pretty intuitive and doesn’t take too long to understand.\nSurvive the pitch\nYou get three free kicks to make under increasingly difficult conditions. Starting with an empty net, the game progresses to have a goalie and, later, an increasing wall of defenders that really ramps up the challenge. When you’ve missed three goals, it’s game over. You get a high score and the chance to try and beat it in the next game.",
