    "description": "8 Ball Pool Billiards is just like your classic pool game, where your objective is to pot your balls into the pockets. This game adds a fun twist in that you can play with random players from all around the world, helping you enhance your game to a pro-level with continued practice.\nThe game begins with a break shot where you hit the cue ball to scatter the other balls. Your objective is to pot the balls into pockets using the cue ball where possible. The first break will tell you whether you are stripes or solids, depending on what ball you get in the pocket first.\nIn each turn, aim to strike the cue ball to hit your target ball into a pocket. If successful, you continue your turn; otherwise, your opponent takes their turn. The key is to use strategic shots to position the cue ball for the next play and try to control the table by positioning balls to your advantage. The direction of where your ball will land is outlined from the stick to the ball with an arrow, giving you an indication of the target path.\nThe player who pots all their balls first wins the game.\nChoose from numerous game rooms such as a private two-player game between you and your friend, a quick play game where you choose your level and play against the public quickly, or a local play where you may need to wait a bit to be matched with a live partner.",
