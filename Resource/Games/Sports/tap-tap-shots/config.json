    "description": "The gameplay in Tap-Tap Shots is pretty straightforward: it is a one-button game where each click propels your ball. Depending on your tap, your ball may or may not make the shot.\nThe net moves to a different height and location each time you make the shot. This will test your click skill. The game, in essence, is an endless series of rounds of practice shots. Your best scores are tallied, incentivizing you to improve upon your performance in the last round.\nThe key to the game is to find the right rhythm when tapping, hence the name tap-tap. How many taps do you need to make every shot?",
