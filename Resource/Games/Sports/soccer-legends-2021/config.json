    "description": "The objective is simple: get the ball into your opponent's net while defending your own, but with these high-powered skills at your disposal, each match becomes a thrilling test of strategy and timing. The combination of character abilities adds an exciting twist, making every game feel fresh and unpredictable.\nChoose your game mode\nSet up a game in tournament or friendly mode. You can play Soccer Legends solo or co-op with a friend. You can also set up the teams in a 1v1,2v2, 1v2, or 2v1 configuration.\nProgress through the tournament\nChoose your team and players from a diverse lineup of unique characters, each with their own distinct abilities. Every player comes equipped with one of two special powers—either a fireball kick that blazes across the field with unstoppable force or the ability to teleport, allowing you to quickly reposition and outmaneuver your opponents.\nTo win the tournament, you will need to keep winning and outplay your increasingly challenging opponents. Master the art of the superkick, which lets you launch the ball at blazing speeds toward your rival’s goal, often catching them off guard.",
