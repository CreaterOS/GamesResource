    "description": "Swing and shoot\nYou only need to drag your mouse to move the racket toward the ball. The way you swing the racket affects the ball’s direction. You can move the racket closer or further away for a more timed shot. Try to catch your opponent off-guard with a good angled hit to build up the points.\nScore the most points\nThe match is over when the first team reaches a score of 11. Keep the pressure on your opponent to get there before they do! Each tournament you play has six games with other players worldwide. You can move to the next when you get the trophy for the first country.\nStay focused\nYour AI opponents in the Table Tennis World Tour are dynamic and vary in difficulty depending on the stage you’re at. This changing difficulty level means you must think on your toes to beat your next opponent.",
