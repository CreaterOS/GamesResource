    "description": "Boxing Random throws you into a completely unpredictable boxing match with ragdoll physics, where your surroundings, outfit, and players change each round. Whether you're boxing in business suits, fighting in shorts on a snowy day, or dodging shots and sharks on a tropical beach, no two matches are ever the same!\nThe gameplay is simple, with only one move you can make, which triggers chaotic results. You only need one click to send a punch flying toward your opponent—but here’s a catch—it’s all about landing that knockout punch to the face! With each click, your character moves in unexpected directions thanks to the game’s ragdoll physics, adding a layer of complete unpredictability to every punch and dodge.\nWatch out for special \"pocket pouch\" rounds that pop up unexpectedly. In these rounds, a knockout punch can land anywhere on your body, not just the face, making it even more frantic. Quick reflexes and timing are key!\nEach match is a fast-paced race to five knockouts. The first player to win five rounds is crowned the victor. With its ragdoll mechanics and ever-changing settings, Boxing Random is a wild ride where every click counts and anything can happen!",
