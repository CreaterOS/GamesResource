    "description": "Hungry Ocean: Eat, Feed, and Grow Fish is an underwater IO casual game where you explore the ocean, encountering sea creatures of all sizes like sharks and jellyfish. The question is, which predator is a predator, and which is the prey? Your goal is to grow bigger and become a top predator but you can only do this by eating all the fish possible that are safe for you to eat. Save fish, collect bonuses, and improve your abilities as you evolve from a small fish to the ocean's king.",
