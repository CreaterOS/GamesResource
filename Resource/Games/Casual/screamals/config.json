    "description": "Screamals is a quirky casual game where you stretch and squish your character to dodge obstacles and collect notes. Pull up to grow tall and slim, or pull down to get short and wideâ€”each move is key to survival. Use your shape-shifting skills to outsmart barriers and unleash a musical blast on the final boss.",
