    "description": "Numbers Arena is a math, snake, and merge game altogether in one game. The green number means pluses, the red number means minus, and the yellow x2 is to multiply your number. If your number is higher than your enemies, then you can run up to it to break it. Collect gray numbers enemies drop to grow even more! You will win when you reach the right number. Collect numbers to be the biggest in the arena and smash the rest of your enemies!",
