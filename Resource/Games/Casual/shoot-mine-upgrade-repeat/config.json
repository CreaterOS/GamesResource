    "description": "Shoot Mine Upgrade Repeat is a bounce-powered mining challenge where every shot counts. Fire one of six upgradable bullets—like banana bombs or ghost rounds—and shatter rocks for points and loot. Earn cash, hit the shop for wild gear, and dive deeper into the mine each round. Precision, upgrades, and ricochets decide how far your legacy will go.",
