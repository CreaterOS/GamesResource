    "description": "Ascent is a casual game about evolution and the circle of life. Begin your journey as a lowly aquatic creature at the bottom of the primordial ocean. Your goal is to survive, evolve, and reach the surface of the sea! Consume food to grow bigger. Once you've matured, find yourself a mate. Collect enough biomaterials from decaying creatures for your baby. Take over the child creature, and congratulations, you've climbed one step up the evolution ladder! And so the cycle repeats: grow, reproduce, evolve, and move up through the ocean. Avoid creatures that are not your species. If you die, don't worry; your soul will get another chance! Slip into another young body to continue your journey. But watch out, the foggy realm between the worlds makes it hard to see enemiesâ€”another collision will end the game.",
