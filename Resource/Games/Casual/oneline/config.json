From shielding him against heavy rain to fending off aggressive bees and even angry giants, each level presents a new challenge. Get creative and use the power of One Line to ensure he stays safe, all while enjoying the simple yet satisfying drawing mechanics. The more you play, the more you'll need to think outside the box to keep him protected!",
