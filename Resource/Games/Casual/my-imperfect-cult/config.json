    "description": "My Imperfect Cult is a casual simulation game where you play as the head of the cult and must lead it to greatness! Persuade people to join your cult, perform the rituals, and make their faith grow stronger! When they have full faith in your cult, they will also be your loyal servants! Don't forget to upgrade yourself so it is easier to persuade people and to make them more loyal to you. The game will be more difficult as you go because you'll also have a competitor. Try to recruit as many people as you can and make your church bigger!",
