    "description": "Sky Balls 3D is an exhilarating two-player casual sports game where you test your reactions and reflexes by guiding a ball on a narrow track thousands of meters in the sky, sometimes with guardrails... and sometimes not. You aim to keep the ball on track and avoid obstacles, traps, and gaps. While high in the sky, you not only have to avoid falling, but the real challenge is to do so while collecting coins and keys to unlock new ball skins and sky-boxes. Enjoy simple controls, stunning 3D graphics, and a choice of 1-player or 2-player modes across hundreds of challenging levels.",
