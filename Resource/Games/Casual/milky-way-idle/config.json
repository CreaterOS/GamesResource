    "description": "Milky Way Idle is a multiplayer RPG inspired by Runescape. It features gathering and crafting skills, a flexible combat system, a player-driven marketplace, in-game chat, and leaderboards. The game minimizes active clicking, allowing the automatic repeating of actions until changed. Skills include gathering (milking, foraging, woodcutting), production (cheese-smithing, crafting, tailoring, cooking, brewing), enhancing equipment, and combat (stamina, intelligence, attack, power, defense, magic, ranged). Community features include a marketplace, chat, and leaderboard. Offline progress of up to 10 hours is supported, with upcoming features including tasks/quests, group combat, bosses, and dungeons.",
