    "description": "Orbit is a fun arcade game about gravitation. Launch a comet into space. Once it's in space it will move based on gravity. Make sure that it doesn't hit any planets before the timer runs out. The gravity around planets is higher, so your comet may turn differently when near them. There is a blue bar and an orange bar. If you manage to not hit any planets until the orange bar runs out, you can advance by 2 levels. Rearrange the planets' positions if you face a difficult level. Good luck!",
