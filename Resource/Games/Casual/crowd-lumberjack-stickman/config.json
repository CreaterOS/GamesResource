    "description": "Crowd of Lumberjacks Stickman is a casual game where you must grab an ax and start working! Gather as many lazy lumberjacks into your team as possible and start building houses and buildings on the island! Control the crowd and cut trees. Build an amazing city and explore the island. Start the game solo and gather a horde of lumberjacks as you progress through the levels. Become an energetic mob of lumberjacks on the island. Only the strongest and most assembled team can cut down a large forest and build a city. Unite all lumberjacks on the island and improve their skills. The stronger and faster lumberjacks, the more work they have on the island.",
