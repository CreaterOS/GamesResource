    "description": "Getting Over It is a challenging casual arcade climbing game that puts your patience—and skill—to the ultimate test. Armed with only a hammer, you’ll tackle a steep, obstacle-laden mountain, relying on precise physics to swing, push, and propel yourself upward. Every inch you gain will make you sweat but will be well worth it, and one small mistake can send you tumbling back to the start.",
