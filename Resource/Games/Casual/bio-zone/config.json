    "description": "Bio Zone is a defense game in which you must place and merge weapons and use them to kill zombies. The game is set on a post-2000 Earth, a planet devastated by pollution and swarming with mutated monstrosities. Amidst this chaos, one lone stronghold stands tall. As the commander of this fortress, you bear the weight of protecting humanity's final bastion of civilization. Defeat zombies to earn coins and use them to purchase basic weapons. Merge low-level weapons into higher-level ones on the fortress core interface to increase attack power. Don't let the zombies destroy your base!",
