    "description": "Hextris is a challenging and intriguing puzzle game in which you must try and stack a series of different colored blocks in a hexagonal formation. To make the blocks disappear, you must match three together of the same color â€“ once you have matched three together, they will disappear. Continue to match the shapes together to prevent them from stacking up and blocking the screen.",
