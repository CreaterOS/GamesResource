    "description": "Where's My Pizza? is a fun casual game where your job is to create, cook and deliver pizzas to your hungry patrons! The journey is not always an easy one. Try not to lose any pizzas (or your head!) If you make a safe delivery, you'll get handsomely rewarded. Customers love to give big tips if the pizzas are cooked to their high expectations. Once your revenue is flowing, it's time to buy new ingredients, bigger ovens, and more pizza trailers for your bike so you can be the biggest pizza powerhouse in town!",
