    "description": "Rocket Boom: Space Destroy 3D is a casual rocket launch game with a cool customization system where you can adjust your rocket ability and launch it to destroy the planet. The cool thing is that all the changes you make are reflected in the rocket's appearance itself. It can be thicker with powerful blasts but weaker in fuel, or vice versa. Find the perfect balance and create your own unique rocket. Destroy cities and continents to conquer the entire galaxy!",
