    "description": "Load Up and Kill is a killing simulation game in which your only goal is to kill a prisoner with whatever weapon you desire. You will be shown some weapons, and after choosing one, you have to load it up (if it needs ammo). Each weapon is filled differently, so you have to find out what you need to do to load them (like first releasing the magazine on a handgun, or pressing the on switch on a chainsaw). Once you're done with loading your weapon, you're taken to the prisoner's cell to do the job. You can keep doing this until you've had your fill, so try out all the different weapons available and see how each of them works!",
