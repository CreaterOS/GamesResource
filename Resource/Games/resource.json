Your score is determined by kills and time spent. Pay attention to your opponent's weapon. You won't be able to kill easily without an upgraded weapon, so you will want to move from a club to a weapon of choice to be a bit more competitive on the battlefield.\nThere are plenty of ways you can level up, but the easiest way is to collect orbs. You can also collect coins by slaying enemies. Currency is key. The more you destroy, the more coins you get, which helps you level up and unlock powerful upgrades, turning you into an unstoppable force on the battlefield.

Take control by dragging units to towers to capture them, then fortify your strongholds by selecting and upgrading towers with enhancements. With 27 unique towers and ten diverse unit types marked by distinct symbols, every decision matters as you build your path to ultimate domination.\nVictory hinges on capturing and holding as many towers as possible, but defending your king is critical—losing it will cost you the game. Develop a strategy that balances offense and defense: build supply lines for resources, strengthen your buildings to boost capabilities, and consider alliances with other players to maximize your success. Working with allies can be a game-changer, as it may prevent being overrun by enemy forces while expanding your territory and resources.\nTo gain ground, drag and drop your forces to unclaimed areas, but be strategic, as occupying new territory takes time, leaving you vulnerable to counterattacks. Follow the directional arrows to see where to expand next, but think carefully about each choice, as capturing the right buildings can amplify your strength. Make tactical decisions to avoid being surrounded, and position yourself to attack your enemies to claim more land and resources.\nIn this multiplayer experience, teaming up with other players can add a crucial layer of strategy. Use the chat messaging function to request or accept alliances, which prevent attacks between allies. Keep communication open to coordinate defenses and time attacks, and build a formidable coalition. You can dominate the battlefield and expand your empire—one tower at a time.",

Players start as small snakes and work to grow as big and fast as possible by eating food scattered around the game board. The larger the food, the bigger the snake becomes, so aim for watermelons, tomatoes, and other snacks to bulk up.\nBe on the lookout for flashing arrows, which provide a speed boost to help you zip across the board. However, this power-up lasts only for a short time, so make the most of it while it lasts.\nThe key to winning is avoiding collisions with other players. Crashing into another snake’s head eliminates you from the game, so be cautious. If you collide head-on with another player, both snakes are taken out. As your snake grows, maneuvering becomes harder, so keep your movements sharp.\nStrategically use power-ups like magnets and speed boosts to gain an edge. You can activate a speed boost with Left Click or Spacebar, but it only lasts for 2 seconds and comes with a 5-second cooldown. These boosts are critical when trying to dodge or trap opponents.\nWith smooth controls, you can navigate the arena with precision and outplay rivals. As you rack up points, you’ll climb the leaderboard, aiming to become the top snake. The ultimate goal is to dominate the board: dodge, trap, and outsmart your opponents to claim victory.",
