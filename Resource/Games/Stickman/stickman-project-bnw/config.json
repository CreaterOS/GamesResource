    "description": "Stickman Project is a ragdoll physics-based action game, which means you’ll never have complete control over your character’s movements. That’s part of the fun; every battle is unpredictable. The game combines fluid combat, tricky level layouts, and a variety of weapons, challenging you to push through each stage and reach the next.\nThe first few levels are simple and serve as a good opportunity to get used to your character’s movement. You’ll encounter obstacles you need to climb, use the jump control repeatedly, and persist until you clear them.\nAs you face enemies, you can fight barehanded with kicks, but weapons give you a major advantage. Learn to pick them up quickly, look out for bats, swords, shields, dynamite, and potions that increase your size and power.\nAt the end of each round, you’ll need to project yourself into an elevator to get to the next round, but it won’t open until you’ve defeated every enemy on the level, so if it stays closed, search for any opponents you might have missed.\nEach round becomes progressively harder, with more dangerous enemies and trickier environments. Master your movement, collect weapons, and adapt to the chaos to survive.",
