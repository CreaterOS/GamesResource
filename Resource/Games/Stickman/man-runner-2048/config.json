    "description": "Your ultimate aim is to merge men to reach the 2048 level, gather the highest score possible, and fire powerful cannonballs at the end to damage giant monsters and take control of the islands.\nEach course starts off pretty simple. You will need to run through a course head-on, filled with obstacles, while collecting as many points as possible. The gamescape is set up like a runway, and obstacles are everywhere. They could be right in front of you, coming from below, dropping from above. Stay vigilant and keep your eye on the prize. You want to make it to the end of the course.\nAlong the way, grab green rewards and pink diamonds for big score boosts, but avoid anything red or items that divide your points. At the end of the course, you will face a giant skeleton. Aim carefully to hit your target. Experiment to find its Achillesâ€™ heel, sometimes right between the eyes, works for maximum damage to earn extra points. You may not be able to defeat it right away, but each attempt helps you rack up a higher score.\nEach round brings about new obstacles, and in some, you will be met with sliding floors that can help you gather more points if you move skillfully. Be careful of spikes that rise from the ground and bombs that drop from the sky, both of which can cost you the run.\nBetween runs, you can buy accessories to customize your character.",
