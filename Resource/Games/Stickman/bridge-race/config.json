    "description": "Bridge Race is an oddly satisfying game where you aim to collect as many blocks of your color as possible and carry them across the board to build a bridge. The objective is to create a path that leads you to the next collection area and, ultimately, to the finish line. Victory is sweet, but the challenge continues as each round gets more difficult.\nThe game is designed to be both simple and rewarding, with delicate sounds that create a satisfying atmosphere. You'll encounter obstacles like slides and elevators, which add a fun element as you navigate through the level, taking you closer to the next challenge.\nBut you’re not alone in this race. Other players are also collecting blocks to build their own bridges, and they’re more than happy to challenge you along the way. If you’re not careful, your opponents can sabotage your progress by building over your bridge, undoing all the hard work you’ve done. And if you run out of blocks and need to return to collect more, be prepared for your opponents to steal your blocks, changing their color to match yours and forcing you to start the process over again. You’ll also have to watch out for being knocked down by other players, which causes you to lose all the blocks on your back.\nThroughout the game, you’ll encounter rewards scattered across the map. Green rewards multiply the number of blocks you carry, giving you an advantage, while red ones will diminish your collection, so it’s important to avoid them at all costs. Stay vigilant, collect wisely, and you’ll be on your way to victory!",
