    "description": "You begin in a classic arcade-style side-scrolling screen, where you’ll quickly get accustomed to the game’s controls. Use the up arrow to jump, the down arrow to attack, and the left and right arrows for movement. Before long, you’ll encounter enemies—attack them by holding the down arrow to unleash a series of sword strikes. Holding down the attack key continuously lets you deliver multiple hits, which is essential since enemies require several strikes to be defeated.\nThough you can jump and sprint past enemies to reach the end of the level quickly, you won’t be able to progress to the next round until all foes are eliminated. If you leave any behind, you’ll have to backtrack and take them out. Once every enemy is defeated, and you reach the final portal, your stickman will celebrate with a happy dance, signaling that you’ve successfully cleared the level!\nAs you advance, the difficulty ramps up with more enemies and tougher challenges, so stay alert and fast on your feet! Use the arrows for guidance on enemy locations and areas you may have missed. Throughout the course, prompts will also direct you to jump to high platforms or descend into lower areas.\nEach round rewards you with points that can be used to purchase upgrades, boosting your power and making it easier to defeat stronger enemies. Plus, you can customize your stickman by changing skins, giving your hero a fresh look as you fight your way through each increasingly intense round!",
