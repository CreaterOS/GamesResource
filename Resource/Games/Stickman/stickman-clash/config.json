    "description": "Stickman Clash combines fun, chaos, and unpredictable physics, making every battle a unique experience! Stand out in battle by customizing your stickman! Choose your character's colors, heads, and weapons to reflect your unique style.\nChoose from an arsenal, including boxing gloves, ice cream, boots, daggers, guitars, katanas, bombs, portal guns, and scythes. Each weapon adds a unique twist to your strategy.\nBattle in stunning environments like a sea surrounded by a giant octopus. But beware, the creatures are the least of your worries as chaos unfolds!\nStickman dynamics make every move unpredictable, and your movement is limited by the WASD keys. Your character flops around, making precise targeting difficult. However, constant movement can work in your favor: itâ€™s harder to hit a moving target and easier to surprise your opponent with unexpected strikes.\nStickman Clash is designed for one or two players, and three- and four-player modes are planned for even more chaotic fun!\nSurvival mode\nWork together to fend off waves of monsters and defend your base. Use bombs strategically to clear crowds without harming teammates.\nBoss Fights\nThese epic battles test your skills. The pickaxe-wielding boss is especially challenging, dodge its attacks and counter with well-timed bombs. Teamwork and precision are your best allies here.\nGame Tips\nStay agile:The more you move, the harder you are to hit.\nUse the environment:Maps come with unique challenges and opportunities.\nMaster timing:Especially in boss fights, precision and teamwork are key.\nExperiment:Try different weapons and strategies to discover what works best for you.",
