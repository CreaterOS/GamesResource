    "description": "Your goal in Splatman is to outmaneuver and defeat your opponents in a tight arena by ambushing them with high-speed paint blasts from your weapon. You start by choosing the number of players on your team—you can go solo or team up with a partner, both playing from the same keyboard. If you're feeling bold, you can even control both characters yourself to double the challenge!\nOnce you enter the arena, don't stay in one spot for too long. Like any great arena game, offense is key, so keep moving to gain the upper hand. Try to corner your opponents, but remember—staying on the move makes you a harder target. If you find yourself on the defensive, use obstacles in the center of the arena to avoid direct hits.\nCustomize your gameplay by upgrading to new paint colors or more powerful paint guns. As you accumulate rewards and points, you'll unlock better equipment, with upgrades starting at 2,000 coins. It may take a few games to build up enough currency, but the right upgrades can significantly boost your chances of victory.\nKeep an eye on key stats like health, damage, and rate of fire to see where you might need an upgrade. If your fire rate is slowing you down, consider investing in a faster, more powerful paint gun to dominate the competition!",
