    "description": "Start an assassin contract\nSelect your mission at the guild from a range of easy to hard choices. The gold earnings scale up with the difficulty of the task. Once the contract has been initiated, head into the city to execute the mission.\nComplete your mission\nClimb buildings and scope out the area like a ninja assassin. Look for clues and stay out of sight to keep it stealthy. When you find the target of your mission, swoop in for the kill and evacuate the area amidst the moment's confusion. If you want to go in all guns blazing, get on a horse on the city's outskirts and give 'em hell.\nBuy various upgrades\nOnce you’ve done the deed, return to the guild to claim your gold reward. You can use your gold to buy various upgrades. Head to the weaponsmith and buy swords, axes, makibishis, and more. Swing by the spellmaster to buy powerful spells for your next adventure. You can also hire a gang of assassins to accompany you on your next trip into the city!\nHead to new frontiers\nWhen you’ve earned enough gold, you can buy access to a boat that will transport you to various new locations, where you can complete new missions that yield higher earnings. You’ll also find gold chests around the guild zone that you can open once you’ve reached the required level.",
