    "description": "The entire game is based on quick thinking, strategy, and decision-making. Along the way, you'll find help from the environment and even old or new friends. Each sequel is tied into the previous game (i.e., Escaping the Prison happens because of Henry's criminal actions in Breaking the Bank). Not every choice you make will lead to a bad ending, but some lead to \"fails\" from the get-go. In Breaking the Bank, every choice will be a failure.\nThis is probably to set Henry up for his next adventure as he tries to escape from prison. The fact that you can't really predict which choice makes the most sense means Fleeing the Complex is just as unpredictable as the earlier games (except Breaking the Bank).\nReleased in 2015, Fleeing the Complex is the 5th and (so far) last sequel in the Henry Stickmin adventure series. Like the earlier games (Escaping the Prison,Stealing the Diamond,andInfiltrating the Airship), the goal is to choose the right paths, tools, and moves while you try to break into or out of different places to escape - or cause - trouble.",
