    "description": "The game starts with your action fighter stickman figure ready to run towards your final level challenge, a fight with a monster that outsizes you. Before you get to the final challenge, you aim to collect as many points as possible on your run to the finish. There are stickmen, keys, jewels, and more to collect, which will help you eventually upgrade your character. You want to grow stronger at each level, which will help you in your fight at the end of the level.\nGameplay controls are fairly simple. You can move left and right with your mousepad or use the A and D keys. You cannot stop your stickman from running; only steer them left or right. Your character runs fast, so it's necessary to be discerning and collect your points wisely. Try to collect stickmen of the same color to grow in strength. If you collect stickmen of different colors than your own, you will weaken. If your character is weakened too much, you risk getting killed, particularly during your end-of-level arena face-off.\nWith a meter challenge, you will have a chance to collect even more pointsâ€”try to stop the arrow at the higher number.\nWhen you have more points, you also get to wear cooler skins. Some of the hats your character will grow into are a witch hat, cowboy hat, unicorn hat, and more fun garb.",
