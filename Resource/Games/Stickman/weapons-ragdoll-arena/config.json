    "description": "In Weapons Ragdoll Arena, your objective is to destroy your opponent with ragdoll physics, driving your weapons. In each round, you have a choice of multiple weapons to fling at your opponent. For example, in round one, they include an ax, a bowling ball, a grenade, and more. Be sure to aim properly so you get your opponent full on.  In round 2, you get a new weapon, and every round, your weapons increase in caliber.\nChoose your weapons based on the strength and placement of your opponent. Each weapon offers a different strength. Some fly through the air, some roll, some explode, and some bounce in unexpected ways.\nWeapons include:\nKnife\nBrowling Ball\nRock\nAxe\nHammer\nFootball\nGrenade\nScissors\nRPG\nAs the levels progress, so do the challenges. You won't be on level playing ground with your opponent, so the logistics begin to get a bit more challenging. Sometimes you will be higher, lower, or on a whole other part of the screen, so aim is key. You will also have more obstacles in your way.\nEach weapon has different stats and can do damage in different ways. Check out the damage, push force, and damage radius of each weapon.",
