    "description": "Playing Pool Match Jam is all about quick thinking and strategic moves. You start with a grid filled with different tubes, and it’s your job to match them with the correct line of swimmers waiting to take the plunge. As you progress, blockers appear to disrupt your matches, tunnels warp swimmers to different parts of the grid, and mystery colors add unpredictability. Use careful planning to clear the grid, overcome these obstacles, and ensure every swimmer finds their perfect match. With each level offering new twists, it’s a fresh and exciting challenge every time you play!\nThe game is filled with fun, but it's not without its challenges—blockers, tunnels, and mystery colors add exciting layers of complexity. These obstacles will push you to think ahead and fine-tune your tactics, making each match more satisfying as you work to keep the flow of fun and excitement going.\nThere are fifteen swimmers waiting across three lines, all dressed in different colors. They can only get onto the tube that matches their own color. If there is no tube available in their color, they can't jump in the water resulting in the game being blocked.\nThe key is to calculate just how many tubers you can accommodate before sending out the tubes so you can choose the right color to keep the line flowing. Only three fit on each tube, so plan accordingly.\nEach level gets harder, with obstacles blocking your access to all your tubes. Remember, free space is your friend, so wherever you find some, you can deploy tubes no matter what row they are in.\nIn the middle of the round, you'll get a little tuber happy dance. Keep them swimming and dancing!",
