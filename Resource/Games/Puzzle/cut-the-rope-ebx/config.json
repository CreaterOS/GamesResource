    "description": "After you pass the tutorial, the game begins with the monster Om Nom inside a box, which gets opened in front of you. Inside the box, there are candies and stars. You'll have to cut the ropes holding the candies in the correct order so the candies swing and collect all the stars, then feed Om Nom. Sometimes, you must slice through the rope at the right moment so it falls in the right direction.\nYou need a certain number of stars to continue progress in Cut the Rope. As you get further, youâ€™ll encounter new puzzle elements like bubbles and air cushions. Use these devices to secure all the stars before feeding little Om Nom.",
