    "description": "The game is a classic puzzle game where you aim to strategically remove bolts so that the panels they are holding up all fall off the game screen. Once you remove a bolt, you need to add it to a free hole. The only obstacle is that there is a limited number of free holes, and some inadvertently get covered by the panels you freed up. This means you need to think a few steps ahead before acting fast.\nAs you advance in levels, the task becomes more complicated, and you need to discern how best to beat the clock. There are over a hundred levels in the game, which become increasingly more complex. No need to worry; the levels may get more complex over time, but you also accumulate more points, which you can use to buy help, such as screwdrivers to remove bolts for which there is no room, or time freezers.\nThis is one of those games where finishing a level brings satisfaction, but then you quickly want to move on to the next round and test your skill once again. It is an addictive game of logic, risk, and quick thinking.\nBolts and Nuts is a feel-good game suitable for children, but it also provides adults with the opportunity to challenge their problem-solving skills.",
