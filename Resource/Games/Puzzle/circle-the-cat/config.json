    "description": "Click the circles to create a barrier. Capturing the cat can be quite tricky. It’s best to start from further away from the cat, because if you build too close, that cat will always find a way to squeeze past!\nWhen you’ve figured it out and built a fairly wide, closed perimeter, you must then fill it with circles until the cat has no circles to jump to. At this point, you’ve circled the cat, and the game starts again.",
