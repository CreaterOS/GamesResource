    "description": "Hexa Sort is a captivating and brain-teasing puzzle game that combines strategy with vibrant design. Your mission is to arrange hexagons on a 19-space board by matching their bold primary colors—blue, red, yellow, green, and more. To clear the board, you must place hexagons of the same color close together. Once aligned and unobstructed, they stack automatically with satisfying ASMR-inspired sound effects, but there’s a catch—they must match exactly. The smooth 3D graphics and vibrant palette make every move visually appealing, creating a relaxing yet immersive gameplay experience.\nThe real challenge lies in the hexagons’ multiple-layered colors, which add a clever layer of complexity. To reveal and match the colors underneath, you must first stack the top layers. This means strategic placement is key; you’ll need to position hexagons near similar colors to ensure cascading matches when the top layers are cleared. It’s a puzzle that requires both foresight and precision and as the stacks build up, so does the satisfaction of mastering each move.\nTo keep things engaging, Hexa Sort includes exciting power-ups and boosters, giving you the tools to overcome even the trickiest situations. Whether you’re a casual player or a puzzle enthusiast, the game’s combination of vibrant visuals, smooth mechanics, and rewarding challenges makes it as relaxing as it is addictive. Dive into Hexa Sort and discover a colorful world where strategy meets satisfaction!",
