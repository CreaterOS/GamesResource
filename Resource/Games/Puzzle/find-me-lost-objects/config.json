    "description": "In Find Me Lost Objects, you'll work through several rounds, including Hello Octopo, Sweet Home, Abandoned Reef, Sea Trip, Ancient World, Walk in Space, In the Insect World, Ghost Town, Polar Expedition, Toward the Dream, and Pirate Island. Let’s start with the first level, Hello, Octopo.\nMeet Octopo, who needs your help in this point-and-click game! Their friend Octopka has disappeared today, and your task is to find her hats. The first one is a striped black-and-white hat with a red ribbon. There are plenty of hats around, but you won’t move on until you find it. You can explore by holding the mouse and moving the landscape, zooming in and out – there’s more to this underwater area than meets the eye.\nNext, Octopo’s hats are dark brown with a brim, and finding them won’t be easy with the colorful, vast sea around you. Keep your eyes peeled! Octopo is getting worried because their favorite Octopushka hasn’t returned, so they suggest heading outside to look for her. Your next task awaits in Sweet Home, where you’ll need to find Octopushka.\nIn Sweet Home, ask around to see if anyone has seen Octopushka. You’ll also need to find a few more objects. One hint is that Octopushka asked the chef Octopus if they had any mushrooms for soup – she must have gone looking for them! Another octopus mentions she was last seen by a fish near the Abandoned Reef, a dangerous place filled with pirates. Better get moving!\nClick on seahorses and fish for points! As you move through each round, new underwater challenges await. Look for items listed in the right menu by exploring the image, and if you’re stuck, use the hint button shaped like a magnifying glass. Good luck!",
