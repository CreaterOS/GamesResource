    "description": "Each level you play in Skydom has an objective. This objective typically involves clearing a certain amount of a particular object or gemstone. When you do, the level is complete, and you get rewarded! Some levels also put you in competition against other players online.\nWhat's unique about Skydom is that every second level, you will have to challenge an opponent to get through and reach the next stage. So the game won't be as relaxed and \"solo\" as most Match 3 games, but there will be some tension and another player to benchmark against.\nAdditionally, after completing 10 levels, you will unlock a Daily Challenge, offering even more opportunities for additional earnings.",
