    "description": "The strategy is the same as the classic pen-and-paper game. You can choose to be a naught or a cross, and your aim is to match 3 in a row to win the game, all the while blocking your opponent from being able to match 3 before you. Thereâ€™s a basic level of strategy to the game that suits all players' ages.\nIn this version of Tic Tac Toe, you can play online multiplayer games or local games against the computer or a friend.\nSet the right difficulty level\nTic-tac-toe is traditionally played on a 3x3 board. In Tic-tac-toe Online, you can expand that to a 5x5 or 7x7 board for a greater challenge and some exciting games! In these larger board sizes, you match 4 instead of 3 in a row, changing the game entirely.\nPlay online multiplayer\nThe online multiplayer game option for Tic Tac Toe is fantastic. There are two modes available: quick match and create a match. If you choose a quick match, you are automatically placed into a random game with another Tic Tac Toe Online player. You can battle it out and rematch them as often as you want.",
