    "description": "There are various strategies you can use to maximize your chances of winning at this multiplayer UNO-inspired game. The main principle is to get rid of all your cards before everyone else. You can do that by matching the color or number of the card placed down before yours. If you don't have a playable card, you must draw cards from the pile until you do.\nWhen you have one card left, press the \"1\" button, otherwise you will be punished with two penalty cards!",
