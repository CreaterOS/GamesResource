    "description": "Everyone's been stuck in a parking jam, but the real challenge is figuring out how to escape!\nThis is a satisfying puzzle game where you click and drag cars to clear them from a crowded parking lot and onto the street. As you progress through the rounds, the difficulty increases, with road barriers and tighter spaces making it harder to maneuver the vehicles. Careful planning is key to getting all the cars out.\nCars can be moved in reverse, allowing for different strategies to clear the jam. Each puzzle comes with a limited number of moves, so youâ€™ll need to think ahead and use them wisely. Your score also reflects how many players have successfully solved the same parking jam, giving you a sense of the challenge level.\nSome levels, like Level 11, are especially tricky due to the sheer number of cars blocking the way. Can you navigate through the toughest jams and free up the lot?",
