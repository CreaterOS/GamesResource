    "description": "The objective of the Solitr game is similar to that of the tabletop card version of Solitaire—you must move all your cards to the four foundation piles located in the upper right corner of the screen, leaving none on the board.\nThe rules are straightforward—stack each pile of cards in ascending order from King to Ace of the same suit. Once you have a complete ascending order, you can place these cards in the upper right corner. There is a hidden stockpile at the top left of the screen, which you can choose to display one or three cards, but only one will be available for movement at a time.\nYou will want to strategically move the uncovered stockpile card onto one of the seven tableau columns, depending on whether it can be placed in ascending order. You can drag cards to move them onto the seven tableau columns or to the four foundations. Remember that the seven columns only allow for alternating colors to be placed in ascending order.\nFor building rules, cards in the foundations must be stacked by the same suit in ascending order, from Ace to King. In the tableau, cards need to be stacked in alternating colors, from high rank (King) to low rank (Ace). Additionally, any empty spots in the tableau can be filled with a King of any suit.\nAs the deck is shuffled in random order, you must carefully strategize to find the correct moves as you reveal cards one by one. This is the essence of the solitaire challenge.\nYou can move either single cards or piles of cards within the tableau, but you can only move cards from the waste pile. Whenever you expose a face-down card in a tableau column, that card will automatically turn face-up for you.",
