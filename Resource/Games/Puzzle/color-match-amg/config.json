    "description": "In Color Match, your goal is to match the color of an object presented to you using a series of available colors. The challenge is to mix and combine different colors until you reach the correct shade that closely matches the object.\nYou can only move on to the next round once you've matched the color to a high percentage. At first, if you manage to match 60% of the color, you’ll need to keep experimenting. At 70%, you're getting closer, but it's still not enough. When you finally reach 90%, that’s when you’ve nailed it!\nOnce you've mixed the right colors and achieved the exact match, you can apply that color to the object and compare it side by side with the original. This visual comparison helps you see just how close you were to the perfect match!\nThe objects you’ll need to match colors for include a variety of items like an avocado, a tomato, cherries, watermelon, and more. Keep matching and refining your color-mixing skills to progress further in the game!",
