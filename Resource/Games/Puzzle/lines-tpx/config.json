    "description": "The goal of Lines is to connect all the segments across the screen by rotating them into place. Simply click on a line segment to adjust its position until it aligns with the others. Once all the lines are connected, the round is complete, and the next challenge begins.\nThe lines donâ€™t need to be straight, they just need to form a continuous connection. Early levels are simple and require only a few clicks, but the puzzles become increasingly challenging as you progress. Strategic thinking is essential to connect all pieces with the fewest clicks, as no line can remain disconnected.\nHelpful speech bubbles may appear with tips, but they can be hidden by clicking if they block your view. Multiple solutions may exist, and not every puzzle piece needs to be used as long as the lines connect from left to right.\nThe game offers various level packs, starting with the first set of five puzzles. Some puzzles feature only one valid solution. Use the level selection button in the top-left corner to navigate between levels.\nIf a puzzle becomes too challenging, you can watch an ad for assistance to advance to the next round. With increasingly complex designs, this game offers a true brain-teasing experience!",
