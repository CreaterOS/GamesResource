    "description": "Light Line is a simple yet challenging puzzle game where your goal is to light up every space on the board. Start by tapping the glowing starting point and dragging a continuous line through the blank spaces, ensuring every block is filled without lifting your finger or leaving any block empty.\nIf you’re stuck, don’t worry—use the hint button! It will highlight the correct path to guide you through tricky stages. You only have a few tries, so use it only once you have exhausted all your options.\nWith 100 levels to unlock, the game starts off easy but quickly ramps up in difficulty, testing your logic and precision.\nThe key to success lies in carefully planning your route. Some levels feature complex layouts that require trial and error to perfect. Others are pretty straightforward. Just remember you can't light the same cube twice, so plan ahead and don't hesitate to try again. You can always trace back and erase your steps to start the round over again.",
