    "description": "Step into a room filled with mirrors and intricate puzzles, where every reflection holds a clue. Your goal is to decipher the hidden patterns, align the mirrors correctly, and unlock the path to escape.\nThis first-person pov game will have you nudging at door knobs and circling the room looking for the next clue.\nStart by analyzing the mirror with digit tiles: observe how numbers reflect and use them to crack the passcode. As you progress, you'll encounter color-coded symbols, stepping platforms, and a locked drawer requiring precise rotations. Each puzzle builds upon the last, challenging you to interpret mirrored hints, decipher sequences, and manipulate objects strategically.\nUse collected mirrors to reveal new clues, unlock compartments, and align reflections. Rotate objects according to their mirrored angles, match colors based on their reflections, and follow step-by-step sequences to activate hidden mechanisms. Keep an eye on details like the positioning of arrows, reflections of letters, and the direction of laser beams bouncing off mirrors.\nWith each successful puzzle solved, you'll gather keys, tools, and hints leading you closer to the final escape. Precision, observation, and logical thinking will guide you through this mind-bending mirrored maze.",
