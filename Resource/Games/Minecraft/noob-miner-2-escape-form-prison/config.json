    "description": "You’ve been caught stealing diamond apples... again! Now you’re locked up in a prison, forced to toil away in the mine as part of your punishment. But this isn't just any ordinary prison labor—there’s more at stake here than just digging for ores. You need to stay sharp and well-fed, so always stock up on food and enhancement potions before heading underground, or you’ll starve to death!\nAs you work through your grueling days, you’ll be assigned to incomplete building projects and resource extraction, where you’ll uncover hidden opportunities that could lead to your freedom. Keep your eyes peeled for the Super Pickaxe—a tool so powerful it could be your key to escape!\nAlong the way, visit merchants to purchase better pickaxes, potions, and other essential supplies to boost your mining efficiency. These tools will help you dig deeper, extract more valuable resources, and stay one step ahead of your captors. Who knows what secrets the mine holds? Keep digging, upgrading, and planning your way to freedom!\nChallenge yourself and earn maximum coins. Get to know the characters of the prison. Be attentive; perhaps they are hiding something from you. Get as many upgrades as possible so you can mine resources faster and more efficiently. Increase your luck to mine more resources per block. Upgrade your mine to generate more ore. Find, buy, and sell resources to merchants: new different kinds of picks, food, torches, dynamite, and much more.\nDon't get too used to this vibrant life in prison—your aim, after all, is to escape.",
