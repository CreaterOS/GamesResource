    "description": "Step into a vibrant pixelated world where your mission is clear: defend the Noob village from relentless waves of invading enemies. To survive, you’ll need to merge characters pairing identical warriors, animals, and skeletons—to create stronger, tougher fighters. Each round gives you only a limited number of moves to merge and plan your defenses before the battle begins, so every decision matters.\nTypes of Fighters:\n🗡️Warrior- Brave and bold frontline defenders.\n🐾Animal- Quick and nimble fighters with surprising strength.\n💀Skeleton- Fearless undead who can take a serious beating.\nWin battles to earn reward money, then use it to unlock new fighters by choosing from three random options at the bottom of the screen. Merge strategically and position your units wisely—placement is just as important as power. As you advance, enemies will become faster, tougher, and far more relentless, so you’ll need to stay sharp and keep upgrading your army to survive.\nGame Tips",
