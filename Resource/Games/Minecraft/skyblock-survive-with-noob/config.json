    "description": "You have a lot of freedom to explore Skyblock with Noob. This sandbox game offers adventure and exploration, making it so addictive. You begin with a few basic resources, but early on, you discover how easy it is to find more all around you. Noob has the potential to dig or break the terrain around him with a left click of the mouse. Chip away to find treasures and essentials and dig across this and other floating islands.\nThere are a few necessary moves to make to explore with Noob properly, and they include destroying blocks, placing blocks, dropping items, checking your inventory, and more.\nA few fun features make it easier to navigate the floating islands, like getting dynamite and using it to explode everything or getting a jet pack; movement is easier as you can glide through the sky. Before that, avoid falling to your death and losing all the hard-earned items you've collected.\nPossibilities are nearly endless with Noob. The important thing is to have fun and explore!",
