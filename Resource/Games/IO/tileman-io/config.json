    "description": "TileMan.io gameplay is relatively simple, but the strategy is not as straightforward. You are in the center of a grid board, and your objective is to expand your territory by claiming more and more tiles. To do this, move your mousepad or use the WASD keys to move left, right, up, and down. Easy enough? The catch is that you need to expand your territory without getting cut off by one of the many other players in the game. You can get cut off if your line of path is cut. Be careful because you can actually cut within your own path and lose the game by accidentally killing yourself. The only way to protect yourself is by remaining on your territory, but doing so won't get your expansion strategy very far.\nTerritory is \"claimed\" when you convert blocks by creating a complete squareâ€”the enclosed blocks will turn to your color once you close the gap. If you go too far and attempt to expand too fast, you will find yourself too far from safety and will likely be killed by an opponent player.\nYou must avoid your opponents or try to trap them within your squares and make them crash into you. Use a careful approach, and don't go in all guns blazing! Can you conquer the TileMan arena?",
