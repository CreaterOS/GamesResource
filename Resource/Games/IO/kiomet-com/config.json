    "description": "The goal of Kiomet is to expand your territory and master tactical moves in a dynamic real-time strategy setting. Take control by dragging units to towers to capture them, then fortify your strongholds by selecting and upgrading towers with enhancements. With 27 unique towers and ten diverse unit types marked by distinct symbols, every decision matters as you build your path to ultimate domination.\nVictory hinges on capturing and holding as many towers as possible, but defending your king is critical—losing it will cost you the game. Develop a strategy that balances offense and defense: build supply lines for resources, strengthen your buildings to boost capabilities, and consider alliances with other players to maximize your success. Working with allies can be a game-changer, as it may prevent being overrun by enemy forces while expanding your territory and resources.\nTo gain ground, drag and drop your forces to unclaimed areas, but be strategic, as occupying new territory takes time, leaving you vulnerable to counterattacks. Follow the directional arrows to see where to expand next, but think carefully about each choice, as capturing the right buildings can amplify your strength. Make tactical decisions to avoid being surrounded, and position yourself to attack your enemies to claim more land and resources.\nIn this multiplayer experience, teaming up with other players can add a crucial layer of strategy. Use the chat messaging function to request or accept alliances, which prevent attacks between allies. Keep communication open to coordinate defenses and time attacks, and build a formidable coalition. You can dominate the battlefield and expand your empire—one tower at a time.",
