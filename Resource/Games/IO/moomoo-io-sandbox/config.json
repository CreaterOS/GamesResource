    "description": "The sandbox is where you go for unlimited resources, to try out new ideas and push them to the limit. Place as many items as you want and build the most epic base.\nOther than that, it's the same as MooMoo.io, and you can still be killed by other players, who also have unlimited resources. If you want a more peaceful game to test your creativity, it's wise to find less populated servers.",
