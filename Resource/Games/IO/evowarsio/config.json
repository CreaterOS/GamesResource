    "description": "Embark on an epic quest across the digital battlefield, where you’ll collect powerful orbs to evolve your warrior into unstoppable forms. As you slash through enemies with swords, axes, and a brutal arsenal of weapons, each battle pushes you closer to becoming the ultimate warrior. With more than 15 unique character models to unlock, your journey is one of constant evolution and power.\nYou control a constantly advancing warrior with your mouse, swinging your weapon to defeat enemies and collect XP to evolve into stronger forms with bigger weapons and greater attack range. As you play, you'll unlock more evolutions and customize your warrior with different weapons and gear to eliminate all other fighters on the field while growing stronger.\nAs you accumulate points, you will be able to upgrade gameplay dynamics. It will take some time to reach your desired destination. It's not the easiest game to master.\nThe key to this 2D top-down game is winning battles. Each victory allows you to grow stronger, but the battlefield isn’t just about brute strength; you’ll need to define your play style and use every opportunity to outmaneuver your enemies. Whether you’re charging headfirst into combat or taking a more tactical approach, dominance is at your fingertips.\nThere is a very large online community around EvoWars.io and when playing it you'll face opponents from every part of the world: it is particularly popular in Vietnam, where it is one of the most popular browser games.",
