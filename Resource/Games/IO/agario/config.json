    "description": "The game has 2 simple rules to follow:\nSlide around the Agario battleground, trying to exist as a single cell looking to evolve. Think like a survivor - donâ€™t just avoid bigger agar, go in for the kill and eat as much as you can!\nPick up all the smaller blobs and eat the other players to grow larger in size. Avoid blobs bigger than you as they will consume you, which means game over! But you can always start the game over and go for your next best record.",
