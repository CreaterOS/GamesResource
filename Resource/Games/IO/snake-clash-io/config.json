    "description": "Snake Clash.io brings a fresh take on the classic snake game with immersive 3D gameplay and modern mechanics. Players start as small snakes and work to grow as big and fast as possible by eating food scattered around the game board. The larger the food, the bigger the snake becomes, so aim for watermelons, tomatoes, and other snacks to bulk up.\nBe on the lookout for flashing arrows, which provide a speed boost to help you zip across the board. However, this power-up lasts only for a short time, so make the most of it while it lasts.\nThe key to winning is avoiding collisions with other players. Crashing into another snake’s head eliminates you from the game, so be cautious. If you collide head-on with another player, both snakes are taken out. As your snake grows, maneuvering becomes harder, so keep your movements sharp.\nStrategically use power-ups like magnets and speed boosts to gain an edge. You can activate a speed boost with Left Click or Spacebar, but it only lasts for 2 seconds and comes with a 5-second cooldown. These boosts are critical when trying to dodge or trap opponents.\nWith smooth controls, you can navigate the arena with precision and outplay rivals. As you rack up points, you’ll climb the leaderboard, aiming to become the top snake. The ultimate goal is to dominate the board: dodge, trap, and outsmart your opponents to claim victory.",
