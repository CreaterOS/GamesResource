    "description": "The aim of the game is to destroy your enemies in the arena—kill or be killed. You are in an arena together with other players from around the world. Destroy your way through the competition with your massive mallet, unleashing chaos and destruction in every swing! Is the game gory? Only if you want it to be. You get to choose your gore level, choosing from blood effects that are not at all standard or brutal, not for the faint of heart.\nThe game is fast-paced, and you will need to hold your own out there in the arena. Your score is determined by kills and time spent. Pay attention to your opponent's weapon. You won't be able to kill easily without an upgraded weapon, so you will want to move from a club to a weapon of choice to be a bit more competitive on the battlefield.\nThere are plenty of ways you can level up, but the easiest way is to collect orbs. You can also collect coins by slaying enemies. Currency is key. The more you destroy, the more coins you get, which helps you level up and unlock powerful upgrades, turning you into an unstoppable force on the battlefield. Crush your enemies, dominate the arena, and when you’ve laid waste to everything in sight, dive into a new lobby to wreak havoc all over again!",
