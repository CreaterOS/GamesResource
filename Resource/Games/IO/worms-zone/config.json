    "description": "WormsZone.io is survival of the fittest. You're a worm, and you must eat and grow to be big and strong. Who knew being a worm could be so much fun? Try to trap your opponents so you can get all of their delicious food.\nPressing the left or right mouse button allows you to turbo-speed your worm. Use it sparingly and tactically to sprint ahead of the other players and secure big rewards, but be advised: the more you use your turbo, the faster your worm shrinks.\nAs you get larger, you get slower. Turbo also becomes more costly for your score, so use it sparingly when you are big and plentifully when you are small.\nBe aware that upgrades you can buy in the menu don't make your worm perform better in the arena, but improve the effectiveness and/or duration of the power-ups found while playing, so don't be tricked by those.",
