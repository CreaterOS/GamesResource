    "description": "You can start a game in one of three available modes: normal, survival, or arena.\nIn Normal Mode, your mission is to collect cubes and race to a maximum score of 262k. But beware—other players are out to steal your cubes and take you down! Reach the target first, or be left in the dust.\nIn Survival Mode, it’s all about scoring big before the clock runs out. Push your skills to the limit as you aim for the highest score possible within the set timeframe.\nFor the ultimate challenge, step into Arena Mode, a high-stakes battle royale where only the strongest survive. Fight to be the last player standing in this thrilling survival showdown!\nPower-up your player\nIn every game mode, there are power-ups, like faster movement, that help you collect more blocks in a shorter time. You can also buy power-ups from the marketplace and activate them anytime during the game.\nThe game is available in four languages: English, Turkish, German, and Russian.",
