    "description": "Clashball is a fast-paced multiplayer arena where a homing ball relentlessly hunts players, and it only gets faster with each deflection. When the ball turns red, it's locked onto you. Click or press C at just the right moment to slash it with your blade and send it flying toward someone else. Mistime it, and you're eliminated.\nYou’ll start in the lobby, where you can watch matches. Head to the training zone in the top corner to practice—here, the ball bounces between you and the central pole, perfect for sharpening your reflexes.\nOnce the game begins, you're teleported into the arena. Fight to survive by dodging, deflecting, and aiming the ball at others. The longer the game goes, the faster and more chaotic it gets. Eliminate opponents and be the last one standing to win!\nAs you play, you’ll level up and earn coins. Use them to upgrade your movement speed, jump height, ball speed, and the number of times you can jump in a row. You can also unlock customization options like new outfits, hats, hairstyles, and swords.",
