    "description": "Squirm your worm around the big arena. Pick up food to grow and boosts to give you a temporary advantage over your slithering opponents. Block the path of another worm to kill it and feast on all the food they have picked up.\nEarn coins and use them to buy various worms, each with its unique skill tree that can be improved on as you play more games. The skill tree grants you permanent buffs to the worm you are upgrading. Complete your daily tasks to earn gems and other rewards!\nA key to success in this game is to use the speed boost effectively. The speed boost can be activated by either of the two mouse buttons or by pressing the space bar if you are using a keyboard. Enabling the speed boost lets you be faster than your opponents, so you can try to trick them to bump into you, but, at the same time, it consumes your mass, so using it requires balance and attention.",
