    "description": "The basic gameplay of Little Big Snake is to eat food and grow your snake. The glowing orbs and nectar are your sustenance. Youâ€™ll find these orbs scattered around the map, inside bugs, and left behind by snakes that have perished. Eating any of these food items will make your snake larger and provide energy for speed-boosting without affecting your snake's size.\nThe quickest way to evolve into the ultimate snake is by trapping other snakes and larger bugs. The larger bugs often drop upgrades that, in one way or another, allow you to progress quicker by providing a time-limited advantage.",
