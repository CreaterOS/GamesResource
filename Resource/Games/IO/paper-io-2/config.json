    "description": "Use your mouse to move around and cover the floor with your color. Glide over white space and other players’ paint, then create a connection back to your color to claim that area. You can also destroy other players' territory completely by crashing into their tail when they are exposed.\nThat also means when you’re moving outside of your color, your tail is exposed to attack. Other players can crash into it to obliterate you.\nComplete objectives and eliminate other players to unlock new skins and make the map more colorful.\nYou’ll constantly be battling with other Paper.io 2 players to reclaim your territory and take theirs. Think strategically about how to claim the most land, and don't get too greedy!",
