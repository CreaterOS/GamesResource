    "description": "Tanks 3D throws you into a tense, action-packed battlefield where it's every tank for itself. You're up against players from around the globe, and the goal is simple: survive and eliminate as many enemy tanks as possible.\nYour tank is built for rough terrain. It can climb steep hills and drop into deep valleys. These low areas might offer protection from enemy fire, but they can also be dangerous ambush zones if enemies are lurking nearby.\nWhile your tank can take a few hits, too much damage will destroy it. Once you're taken out, you'll have to restart, so choose your movements carefully and stay alert at all times.\nYou can communicate with other players in real time using the chat box located at the bottom of the screen. The leaderboard in the top right corner shows the scores of all players currently in the match, helping you track your progress.\nThe minimap on the screen gives you a sense of where enemy tanks are located and how close they are to your position. Use this to plan your attacks or your escape.\nYou’ll also see soldiers walking around the map. They’re easy to take out, but they can also act as warnings that an enemy tank might be nearby.\nStay alive, shoot fast, and take control before someone else does.",
