    "description": "SPEED is one of the more classic card games that involves, well, speed. The goal of the game is to be the first player to discard all of the cards on your hand. You do this by choosing a card from your hand that is 1 step higher or lower than one of the 2 cards in the middle of the screen. This is where the title comes it - you won't be taking turns doing this. You'll need speed as the cards in the middle can only be used by the first player to discard their own cards there.",
