    "description": "Hanafuda Flash is exactly as the title suggests - it's a flash version of a classic Japanese card game, Hanafuda. This card game involves 2 players throwing and taking cards to/from each other to create a set of cards from a \"suit\". There are multiple suits with different points depending on the cards you've collected. This game will need a bit of studying, but once you get the hang of it, this game is super fun because of how fast the game starts and ends.",
