    "description": "Outpost: Zombie Apocalypse is an action survival game where you stand as the last survivor against the undead. Your goal: endure as long as you can. Construct strongholds, forge weapons, and lay traps. Survival is paramount, particularly during the perilous night hours. Daytime offers relative safety to gather resources, repair, fortify defenses, set up fixed weapons, lay mines, and illuminate your surroundings. Yet, as darkness falls, you become vulnerable while the zombie horde's senses sharpen. Your only hope is a well-prepared, illuminated base where you must stand your ground to survive until dawn. As each night grows more treacherous, adapt, upgrade, unlock new weaponry and structures, and strive to outlast the relentless zombie onslaught.",
