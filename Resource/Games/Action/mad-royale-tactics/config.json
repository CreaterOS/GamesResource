    "description": "Mad Royale Tactics is a turn-based battle royale where strategy and precision decide your fate. Command a mini tank, plan each move carefully, and unleash tactical shots to outsmart opponents. Use the terrain to gain the upper handâ€”knock enemies off platforms, deflect incoming fire, or land mid-air hits. Outsmart, outmaneuver, and be the last tank rolling!",
