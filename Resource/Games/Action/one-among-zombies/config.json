    "description": "One Among Zombies is a turn-based strategy game where you must survive the zombies. The majority of the population perished due to the use of poisons and chemicals by the armies. Those who were lucky enough to survive had to wear protective suits and venture to the surface of the contaminated planet in search of remaining useful resources, sustenance, and equipment. As a result of the last war, the dead lost their eternal peace. It is unknown which chemicals were used, but they caused partially decaying bodies to move once again and feel an incredible hunger, which can only be partially satiated by a warm piece of fresh meat.",
