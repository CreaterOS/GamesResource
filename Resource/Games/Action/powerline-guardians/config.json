    "description": "Powerline Guardians is an intense defense game set on Mars, where you step into the boots of a fearless protector. A team of powerful drills works relentlessly to extract valuable Martian ore, but they rely on five vital power lines to keep running. Swarms of hostile Martian spiders are determined to cut those lines and bring the operation to a halt. Your mission is clear: defend the power lines at all costs. Blast through waves of spiders, repair damaged wires, and ensure the drills stay powered until enough ore is collected. As the attacks grow fiercer, youâ€™ll need sharp reflexes, smart strategy, and quick repair skills to prevent total shutdown. Hold the line, repel the infestation, and secure the ore to complete your mission!",
