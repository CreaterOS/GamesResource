    "description": "School Wars is a real time strategy game that pits 4 different schools against each other in a huge turf war. You'll be playing as the gray school, and you'll attempt to take over by letting your units sit on the card face tiles until it changes to your school's color. The more tiles you control, the faster you'll get extra fighters. You win the game by taking over all of the tiles on screen.",
