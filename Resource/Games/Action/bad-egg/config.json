    "description": "Bad Egg is an action game where you play as one little egg who needs to survive and kill the zombie chicken army! Collect the eggs and upgrade yourself to become stronger. Hold on until the chopper picks you up. Get to the chopper, or you're clucked. Try to reach the top of the leaderboard! This is a free-range frenzy of arcade action from the yolked-up eggheads behind Shell Shockers. t",
