    "description": "Battle Masters is a fighting game that lets you duke it out with 3 other fighters in awesome one-on-one matches to the death! The game plays in a rock-paper-scissors format - each turn, both of you will choose a hand, and the winner gets a chance to select an action from a list of commands. The winner can choose to either attack, use a skill, use an item, or wait. You'll keep doing this until either one has lost all of their HP. Choose your fighter and may luck be on your side!",
