    "description": "Shark Simulator Beach Killer is exactly as it sounds – a simulation that allows you to control a 3D shark in shallow waters and the aim is to attack any living thing and rack up a huge amount of kills! This game certainly isn’t for the feint hearted and there is a lot of blood and gore so be prepared! The controls are simple – you control the shark using the WASD keys and attack using the space bar.",
