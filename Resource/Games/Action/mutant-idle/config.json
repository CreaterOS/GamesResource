    "description": "Mutant Idle is an action game where you play as a professor who creates mutants to fight against the army that has a mutant captive. Defeat them to set the mutants free! The rescued mutants will then fight alongside you, and you can strengthen them by combining their DNA using machines you invented. With more mutants, you can increase the number of slots and create new hybrid mutants. Discover different types of mutants and their unique attack animations as you progress through the game. Unlock new slots to join the battle with more mutants and experience the excitement of creating new species.",
