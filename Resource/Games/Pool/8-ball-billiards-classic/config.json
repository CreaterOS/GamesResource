    "description": "8 Ball Billiards Classic is much like the classic in-person game: your goal is to pocket all your balls (either solids or stripes) and sink the 8-ball to win. Use your mouse to aim the cue stick and adjust the power of your shot. Click and drag the cue stick back to set your shotâ€™s power, then release it to strike the cue ball. This is a 2-player game, so carefully plan each shot to outmaneuver your opponent and clear the table before they do!\nYou can use the settings to choose the ability of your AI-controlled opponents and, if you are good at it, you can also remove the visual help that allows you to understand the trajectory of your shots.",
