    "description": "Berzingue is a minimalist 3D racing game where you drive at full speed on the vertiginous roads of the 6 circuits to try to finish first and accumulate enough points. You have to control your speed to avoid going off the track during turns and especially jumps. A division is made up of 3 drivers who will compete for over 6 races and 2 laps per race. The best times are recorded but are not decisive for victory. The game offers 2 profiles, 6 circuits, 4 divisions, 11 opponents, a limited turbo, a replay after each race, and a table of the best times achieved per race and per lap.",
