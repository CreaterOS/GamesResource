    "description": "Ram Cars is a car battle game where you drive and smash an opponent's car by drawing a line. This game offers 3D graphics, different arenas, multiple challenges, upgrades, and rewards! Draw the line to move your car. While planning your path, you will also see the trajectory of the enemy. That is where you need to think fast to react and coordinate your moving direction well to be rammed right into your opponent. The best hits are when you T-bone your opponent, which is not so easy to do! Don't forget to also upgrade your car's health and strength. More health equals harder to smash, and more strength means that a well-planned hit could destroy another fighter in one blow.",
