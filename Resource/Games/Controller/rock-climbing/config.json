    "description": "Rock Climbing is a thrilling casual game where you guide a unique two-headed creature. Stay composed as you aim for your landing spot, holding and releasing the button for a strategic jump. Rotate mid-air for precision, but be cautious not to collide with your second head to avoid unwanted bouncing. If you miss, savor the calming mountain sounds before embarking on your ascent again.",
