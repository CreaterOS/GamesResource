    "description": "Frontier is an adventure game set in the wild west where you play as someone who wants to make it big by trading goods with different cities. This desert-filled wasteland won't make it easy for you though, as pirates and bandits try to rob you, and if you're bringing something illegal, authorities may try to catch you. If you're smart and careful, an opportunity to gain a huge fortune by trading is waiting for you in this barren land.",
