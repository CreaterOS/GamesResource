    "description": "Embark on your quest\nStart your journey as a master of tower defense, tasked with defending a series of castles from imminent attack. On this quest, you’ll battle various enemies, build and upgrade robust defenses, and use a range of epic spells to smite down the attacking hordes.\nPrepare your defenses\nStart the first level and jump into the action. There’s a cool-off period where you can plan your strategy and build defenses before each wave of enemies. Each defense has a unique ability, like long-range archery or wide-impact boulders. Choose wisely where you place each tower.\nUpgrade and use spells\nEvery vanquished enemy delivers gold to your pocket in real-time. Use that gold during battle to place more towers and upgrade the existing ones. Use your spells on large groups of enemies to stop them in their tracks.\nProgress to uncharted lands\nProgress further down the path to victory into new terrains and trickier battles. As you move to the later levels, unique defenses and a litany of new spells await. You’re awarded a star rating for each level you complete. You can replay levels if you want to improve your score!",
