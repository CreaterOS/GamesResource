    "title": "World Z Defense - Zombie Defense",
    "description": "The world is in chaos, and only you can save it. World Z Defense puts you on the front line of a global zombie outbreak, and it’s up to you to save humanity. No pressure. You will start at an ammunition base, where you can recharge your ammunition and prepare for the relentless zombie onslaught. Zombies may be slow, but they’re persistent and will stop at nothing to break through your defenses.\nTo defend yourself, click, drag, and drop your character to aim at approaching zombies. Once you’ve aimed, your position is locked, and all your bullets fire in the chosen direction until you return to the ammunition base. Timing is everything—your ability to take down multiple zombies at once depends on careful planning and aim.\nAs you play, you’ll earn rewards that allow you to upgrade your character, improving crucial stats like reload time and firepower. These upgrades become essential as the hordes grow larger and faster, leaving you less time to react. If zombies break through your barricade, it’s game over—so don’t let your guard down.\nExplore a map filled with different geographical areas, each teeming with zombies waiting to be defeated. Your strategy is key: try to line up as many zombies as possible in your line of fire, as you can only shoot in one direction when away from the ammunition base. Use your resources wisely to become a more potent fighter and save the world from the undead menace. You've got this!",
