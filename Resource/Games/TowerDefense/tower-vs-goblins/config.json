    "description": "In Tower vs Goblins, you’re tasked with defending your tower against waves of attacking goblins, dark magicians, and terrifying demons. Starting with a basic structure, your goal is to build and upgrade your tower while aiming, shooting, and fending off increasingly powerful enemies.\nUse your bow to fire at goblins coming from all directions, both the ground and the sky. As the game progresses, you’ll face new challenges, so be sure to upgrade your weapons and hero to stay ahead. Unlock upgrades like diagonal arrows, multiple front arrows, and ricochet arrows to tackle the growing horde effectively.\nStrategy is key. While the game might seem simple at first, you’ll need to carefully plan where to place your weapons and how to use your resources. After each wave, you’ll have the chance to level up your hero, boosting things like attack power, speed, damage crit, and arrow count. You can also upgrade your fortress, deciding whether to reinforce your defenses or enhance your offensive weapons to keep enemies at bay.\nThe RPG-shooter element keeps things intense, with each enemy wave more challenging than the last. Be ready to aim and shoot with precision, and use your sharp wits to maintain control of the battlefield. The game’s cute design and smooth animations make it not only fun but also visually captivating, making every wave of enemies a spectacle to behold.\nWith each level, you’ll face tougher goblins and more complicated situations, but if you’re strategic and make the right upgrades, you can become an invincible archer, ready to defend your tower from any threat.",
