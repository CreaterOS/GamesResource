    "description": "Age of Tanks Warriors is a one-click battle game, so the actual combat portion of the game is fairly simple. The difficulty lies in devising a strategy for utilizing your army and weapons to eliminate your opponents before they can eliminate you and destroy your fortress. Once you do this, you get to upgrade your army and weapons for an even more effective strategy.\nThe game begins with your stone cave, which is directly opposite your opponent's cave. You can deploy your soldiers by clicking the small icon on the bottom right of your screen. The only hitch is that you may not have enough soldiers to send out in time to match your opponent's troops!\nYour task on each level is to defeat the opposing army and destroy their shelter. As the levels advance, so do the fortresses, making it even more difficult throughout the ages. Fighting begins with sticks and stones, but eventually turns into tanks and artillery.",
