    "description": "Merging Gears is a fun and addictive clicker game where you must build and operate a gear-based mechanism to earn profits. By adding new gears and increasing the speed of rotation, you can make your mechanisms more efficient and profitable. The game simulates the performance of the mechanism in real-time, allowing players to see how each gear affects the system. Players can reinvest their profits to buy new and more advanced gear and become gear masters in the process.",
