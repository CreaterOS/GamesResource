    "description": "Fish Merge FRVR is a clicker  that is both fun and addicting once you get the hang of it. The game revolves around feeding and merging fish to get better fish that'll net you more gold. You'll start with a few empty fish bowls, and dropping in fish feed will attract the most basic fish. Once you have 2 of the same fish type, you can merge them to create a better fish. You'll keep repeating this to unlock all of the higher tier fish as you go. There are a couple of things to help make things easier along the way as well, like a shop to get better fish instantly, and a roulette that'll give you high tier fish every 3 minutes.",
