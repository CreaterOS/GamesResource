    "description": "Planet Miner FRVR is a clicker game where your goal is to amass tons and tons of gold from different planets, so you can get enough gold to access more planets where you can mine more gold, and so on. Don't let that description fool you though, this is not a boring game. There are a lot of things to do, like clearing up meteors, digging up for treasure, and continuously upgrading your planets, miners, and mining materials so you can optimize your farming.",
