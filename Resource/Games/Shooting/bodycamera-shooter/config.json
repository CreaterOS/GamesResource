    "description": "The goal of a BodyCamera Shooter is to stay alive by neutralizing threats and surviving waves of enemies in unfamiliar territory. The emphasis is often on tactical decision-making, realism, and immersion, with a strong focus on precision and careful movement. You must navigate through environments, often with limited resources and visual awareness, to complete these objectives while maintaining your own survival.\nThe key to this game is combined reaction time and precision. There are numerous moves to make, and uncertainty greatly outweighs tactical precision, forcing you to adapt and react quickly to unpredictable situations. WASD or arrow keys will navigate your player, but your strength lies in using your keypad or mouse to aim and shoot.\nFocus on mastering movement while aiming and shooting at first. You'll likely get killed while practicing this, but it is hard to move on to more skillful moves until this is down pat.\nOnce you gain a bit of momentum, incorporate a bit of running (shift key) and jumping (space bar) to avoid enemy fire and navigate your surroundings more quickly.\nThe R key will be vital once you master your craft; it will reload your weapon quickly. Use this when surrounded by enemy fire to avoid wasting time with automatic reloads.\nYou can upgrade your soldier through six different levels, each corresponding to a new weapon that will be unlocked as you progress through the levels.\nThere are four different scenarios for the combat: the first two will be available immediately, while to access the Counter-Strike looking map, you will have to reach level 5, and the last one will only be accessible after reaching level 10.",
