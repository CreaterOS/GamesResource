    "description": "Step into the wild and take on the role of a skilled hunter. Each hunt presents different animals to track and shoot, but the rugged landscape makes them difficult to spot. Staying alert is key, as the terrain provides plenty of cover for your targets.\nYour hunting goals appear in the top-left corner, showing how many deer, boars, or other animals you need to hunt. Completing these objectives earns reward points, and after each successful shot, youâ€™ll see a distance meter displaying how far you were from the target. You can move around to find a better position, but the most rewarding shots come from a distance.\nPrecision is everything. If you miss, the animal will be startled and run, making it much harder to hit. Moving targets requires skill, and a poorly timed shot could turn the hunt against you. If an animal becomes aware of your presence, it might charge, and a wild boar stampede could end the round instantly.\nTo improve your aim, you can adjust both general sensitivity and scope sensitivity. Moving closer may give you an easier shot, but true hunters thrive on long-range accuracy. Survive 100 rounds, master the wild, and prove yourself as the ultimate hunter.\nSharpen your aim, manage your resources, and prepare for the thrill of the hunt in Wild Hunter 3D!",
