    "description": "The game rules and control are fairly simple. There is no strategy involved in Soccer Random; you will simply need to out-click your opponent till you score a goal.\nUse the up arrow or left-click to do your signature and only move. Each team has two players, and they move simultaneously. Each click controls both characters on your team, but only sometimes, as you would want. You can also hold your kick in the air by pressing and holding the action button. This can be useful when kicking randomly or doing nothing could work against you. Though sometimes doing nothing and just standing there can indeed score you a winning goal.\nAfter each goal in Soccer Random, you are transported to a new location with different characters. To win the game, one team must reach five wins before the other!\nYou can play Soccer Random solo or with a friend. Playing a two-player game evokes more action on the field, so try both and see which is more fun.",
