    "description": "Penalty Shooters 3 lets you switch from ball shooter to goalkeeper, so you get to learn the playing ground from all angles. You start the game by choosing the mode you want to play in. If you choose Tier Mode, you will be met with six challenges (Tier 1 - Tier 6). You can only access Tier 1 to begin with until you win enough trophies to unlock other tiers.\nHow many trophies do you need to unlock various tiers?\nThe gameplay is pretty intuitiveâ€”you click, hold, and release to kick the penalty shot when you are the shooter, and similar gameplay of clicking and blocking when you are the goalkeeper.\nIf you want to play in World Cup mode, you must play three matches in tier challenge to unlock World Cup mode. Customize your players' jerseys to make them cool! Test your timing skills with a single click. Compete against AI that will adapt and become more skilled as you progress. There are 250+ whimsical teams, power-ups, and achievements, so the excitement will never stop. Get ready to claim victory!\nDefending\nPro Tip:If your opponent is taking a slow shot, time your dive by tapping slightly later for a better chance of saving it.\nShooting\nPro Tip: Mix up your shooting style! The goalkeeper learns from your moves, so keep them guessing to outsmart them.",
