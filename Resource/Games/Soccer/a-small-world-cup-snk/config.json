    "description": "First thing first, when playing A Small World Cup - you must choose your team. It's the World Cup, so you get to choose from a variety of countries, which include the USA, Argentina, Mexico, Canada, Brazil, Chile, Peru, and plenty more countries. The primary difference between the teams is the color of their shirts.\nOnce you've chosen your team, you will be matched with another World Cup team, and the match begins. It's as simple as that.\nA Small World Cup uses ragdoll gameplay with a left-click aim and release dynamic. This means you will have limited control over movement and must be strategic about what constitutes a winning move, both in offense and defense.\nSmall movements can produce big results, sometimes not in your favor. If you aim and release with too much force, you may find your ball bouncing back and scoring a goal for the opposing team. You may also want to aim for your opponent and use them in gameplay to block the goal.\nThe graphics are vibrant, and the sound puts you right in the center of the soccer field, with the crowd roaring at every goal.",
